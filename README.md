# Intention
This is a repository of all the things I would like to convert into projects, preferably using both R and Python.  Really it's somewhere for me to store all my notes, links, blogs, tweets, hallway whispers, I would like to revisit at some point.  Step 1. organize notes.

# Ambition  

+  structural time series; aka kalman filter; state space modeling   
		+ R package dlm and dse  

+ Bayesian structural time series 
		+ R package BRMS R package
+ Frequency Pattern growth tree -- use for seeing what things happen at the same time
+ ARIMA modeling  
+ exponential smoothing  
+ GAMS  
+ Neural Networks  
+ Natural Language Processing  
		+ sentiment analysis
		+ term frequency-inverse document frequency -- TF-IDF (http://www.tfidf.com/)
		+ creating of word cloud in pre-defined shape and color  
		+ Latent Dirilecht allocation --  used to discover underlying topics (http://blog.echen.me/2011/08/22/introduction-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation/)
		+ (https://algorithmia.com/tags/text-analysis)  
		
+ Poisson Regression  	
+ Random Forest  
+ Gradient boosting  	
+ stanfordâ€™s LP suite (https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/  ) - - tool/framework includes tokenization (text word splitting), tagging part of speech, grammar parsing (noun vs. verbs), named entity recognition, etc.  Else give this python utility a try: http://www.nltk.org/ ;  Similar to the stanford library - supports tokenizing, parsing, named entities identification
